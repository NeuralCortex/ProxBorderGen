## How the program works

ProxBorderGen is a program that generates random geographic coordinates in WGS84 format within a predetermined state or country border in a specific area.</br>
The generated data can be exported as a CSV file.

## A notice

Since the jxmapviewer2 library no longer works, the [corrected version](https://github.com/NeuralCortex/JXMapViewer2) must be used.</br>
An existing internet connection is mandatory.

## Workflow

1. Right click on the map and select the country of your choise
2. Select state or country
3. Generate test data based on the specified width and number
4. Export CSV file (semicolon separated)
